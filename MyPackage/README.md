# Package

- Packages are containers for classes that are used to keep the class name space compartmentalized.
- Packages are stored in a hierarchical manner and are explicitly imported into new class definitions.
- The Package is both naming and visiblity control mechanism.
- We can define classes inside a package that are not accessible by code outside the package.

## Defining a package

```
package pkg_name;
```
