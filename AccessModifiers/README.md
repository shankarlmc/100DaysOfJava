# Access Modifiers

- The access modifiers are used to control the access to the classes, methods, and variables.
- There are four access modifiers in Java:
  - `public`
  - `protected`
  - `default`
  - `private`
- `Private`
  The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.

- `Protected`
  The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through child class. If you do not make the child class, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.

- `Default`
  The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. If you do not specify any access level, it will be the default.

- `Public`
  The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, within the package and outside the package.
